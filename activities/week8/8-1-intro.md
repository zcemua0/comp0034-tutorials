# Adding pages to a Flask app

This week's activities cover pages that interact with data with examples based on the typical features that students
have in their coursework apps. You are not expected to produce all of these in your own app. You may also have features
not covered by these which you will need to research (see ['other'](8-8-other.md)).

- Pages that get data from a database
- Pages that get data from an API
- Pages that capture data with forms
- Pages that include a chart
- Pages that return a machine learning prediction

The activities include alternatives for SQLAlchemy and sqlite3 where relevant.

Completed examples of these and demonstrator apps of other features are given
in <https://github.com/nicholsons/comp0034-tutorial-apps-flask>.
