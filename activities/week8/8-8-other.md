The following sign posts resources for features not covered in this tutorial.

## Integrating your Dash app in your Flask app

Try [Integrate Dash Apps into Your Flask App](https://ploomber.io/blog/dash-in-flask/), though ignore the part about
deploying to the cloud as you are not allowed to do that for the courswork.

There is a Hackers and Slackers tutorial on integrating Flask and Dash however both apps have changed substantially
since this was written.

## Authentication

Please do not apply authentication in your coursework unless it is fundamental to how your app works, for example if you
need to know an identity to be able to complete features such as customising data and saving those customisations.
It is widely documented with readily available boilerplate code.

A few tutorial links that cover authentication:

- [Miguel Grinberg's mega tutorial episode on login](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-v-user-logins)
- [Flask Friday - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxyaJ8w_wak)
- [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-add-authentication-to-your-app-with-flask-login)

There are numerous libraries for authentication. A popular library for apps with pages/views is Flask-Login. If you have
developed a REST API app then consider a JSON Web Token approach instead using libraries such as Flask-JWT-Extended or
PyJWT.

## REST API

REST APIs have not been covered in the module this year.

If you wish to attempt this you need to understand what a REST API is, as well as how to construct one.

REST APIs return structured data, typically JSON, and do not have HTML pages. They are used by developers to access data
that they can use in their own apps. You get the data from a REST API using an HTTP request.

If you decide to generate this type of app in the coursework:

- include code that can be used with [HTTPie terminal](https://httpie.io/cli) to check each route. Required for marking.
- if you implement authentication, provide credentials the marker can use. Required for marking.

You will not be generating pages so please make sure that your app evidences sufficient 'features', consider:

- use SQLAlchemy to interact with the database instead of sqlite3
- document with swagger or other
